//! TCP4.6c — the dual-mutation fuzz harness (dbsqlfuzz mold).
//!
//! One fuzz input co-mutates BOTH sides of the durability contract: the
//! operation stream (commits, deletes, flush, checkpoint) and the on-disk
//! bytes (any file under the store root — WAL segments, table blocks,
//! snapshots, manifests), interleaved across close → damage → reopen epochs.
//! `SQLite` reports this design (`dbsqlfuzz`) out-yields every one of its
//! other fuzzers because the damage lands on state the *continued* workload
//! then exercises — single-shot damage-then-verify never reaches those paths.
//!
//! Oracle stack, judged at every reopen:
//! - A reopen may REFUSE loudly (a typed open error) — safe, the case ends.
//! - A reopen that succeeds **`Healthy`** must be TRUTHFUL: the model is
//!   truncated to the runtime's own `recovered_visible_version` claim and
//!   classified under `CrashFamily::ZeroLoss` — the recovered state must be
//!   exactly the acknowledged history through the claimed watermark. A state
//!   below the claim (health-vs-truth), a hole, a torn batch, or a
//!   fabricated/resurrected row is a violation and panics the target.
//! - A reopen that succeeds **`Degraded`/`Failed`** has DECLARED loss: a
//!   lower watermark is legal, but the state must still be a valid prefix of
//!   acked history (fabrication, holes, and torn batches still violate), and
//!   the case ends — degraded health blocks mutating admission with no
//!   acknowledge path by design.
//! - A read that fails loudly after a damaged reopen is safe (fail-closed)
//!   and ends the case; only silent wrong data is a finding.
//!
//! Epochs end with a CLEAN close before damage: files are quiescent, the
//! listing is stable, and cases replay deterministically. The crash-timing
//! dimension is the recovery oracle's and the whole-DB simulation's job;
//! this target owns the damage-surface × continued-operation product.
//! Durability is `Standard` — the adopt-the-claim oracle is equally strict
//! under either policy and Standard roughly halves per-exec fsync cost.
