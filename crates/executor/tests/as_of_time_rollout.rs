//! #3112 S3b: `as_of_time` across every capability that can time-travel.
//!
//! S3a proved the resolver and wired one pilot command. S3b rolls the input
//! out to the remaining 30, which is mechanical enough that the compiler
//! catches most mistakes — but not the one that matters: a handler that
//! accepts `as_of_time` and then quietly reads the wrong thing, or reads
//! `latest` because the resolved value never reached the engine.
//!
//! So each capability gets the same two proofs the pilot got:
//!
//! 1. **Equivalence** — reading at a commit's `committed_at` returns exactly
//!    what reading at that commit's logical `timestamp` returns.
//! 2. **Discrimination** — the wall-clock read actually distinguishes history,
//!    rather than both sides agreeing because both return current state.
//!
//! Without (2), (1) passes vacuously on a handler that ignores `as_of`
//! entirely — which is precisely the regression this file exists to catch.
