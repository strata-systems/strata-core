# Strata V1 Architecture Support Matrix

Status: V1 product/architecture cross-check

## Purpose

This document checks the V1 product requirements, feature inventory, and user
pathways against the current target architecture:

1. `docs/architecture/strata-v1-architecture.md`
2. `docs/architecture/core-architecture.md`
3. `docs/architecture/storage-architecture.md`
4. `docs/architecture/engine-architecture.md`
5. `docs/architecture/runtime-resource-profile-architecture.md`
6. `docs/architecture/v1-error-and-diagnostics-contract.md`
7. `docs/architecture/v1-testing-and-conformance-plan.md`

The question is not "is this implemented today?" The question is:

> Does the target architecture have the right owner, boundary, and substrate for
> each V1 product feature and pathway?

The answer is mostly yes. The architecture can support the V1 product model if
the follow-up contracts listed here are written before implementation.

## Scope

In scope:

1. V1 local database behavior.
2. V1 storage modes and durability modes.
3. V1 data capabilities.
4. V1 branching, versioning, time travel, and clone substrate.
5. V1 retrieval, graph, vector, search, configuration, diagnostics, CLI, SDK,
   and command-boundary behavior.

Out of scope for this pass:

1. StrataHub Library as a hosted product.
2. StrataHub Fleet as a hosted product.
3. Strata AI assistant experience.
4. Hidden sync, autosync, fleet registration, and cloud coordination.
5. Exact CLI syntax, SDK method names, IPC wire format, and Rust module layout.

This pass still includes the V1 substrate that future StrataHub and Strata AI
work depends on: cloneable datasets, identity/provenance metadata, IPC-required
local multi-process access, explicit network behavior, and structured
diagnostics.

## Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Supported | Target architecture has a clear owner and boundary. |
| Supported, contract needed | The architecture is right, but a follow-up contract must pin exact behavior. |
| Optional substrate | Architecture can support it, but the product feature is optional for V1. |
| Deferred or removed | Product docs exclude it from V1, and target architecture should not carry it forward. |
| Gap | No clear owner or boundary exists yet. |

| Legacy branch bundle workflow | Deferred or removed | Dataset clone becomes V1 product artifact. Branch bundles should be removed, hidden, or redesigned. |
| Disk-backed cache mode | Deferred or removed | Cache is ephemeral. Durable disk use is durable database mode. |
| Hidden network behavior | Deferred or removed | Network, provider, clone, model, sync, or registration effects must be explicit. |
| Public tags and notes | Deferred or removed | Not required for local branch model; may return for dataset releases/provenance later. |
| Manual database maintenance | Deferred or removed | Flush, compact, checkpoint, retention, and recovery are internal lifecycle behavior with diagnostics. |

## Findings

No V1 required pathway currently lacks an architecture owner.

The target architecture is equipped to support the V1 product model because:

1. Storage owns generic persistence mechanics and commit timeline
   substrate without product capability knowledge.
2. Engine owns product semantics: data capabilities, branch behavior, retrieval,
   orchestration, IPC command semantics, diagnostics, and data movement.
3. Intelligence/inference remain above engine for model execution, so search
   and generation features do not corrupt the database boundary.
4. Runtime resource profiling keeps the same-binary edge-to-server promise
   without pushing hardware detection into storage.
5. Removed features are excluded from target architecture instead of preserved
   by inertia.

The main risk is not missing architecture buckets. The main risk is starting
implementation before the follow-up contracts are written. Most V1 pathways
are "Supported, contract needed" because the architecture gives them a home but
does not yet pin exact behavior.

## Required Follow-Up Contracts

Before implementation, the next architecture/product pass should write these
contracts in roughly this order:

1. Data capability implementation contract.
   Repeatable KV/JSON/event/vector/graph pattern over the KV row substrate:
   facade, entity addressing, row families, codecs, reads, writes, branch
   adapter, search adapter, relationship adapter, derived-state hooks, tests.
   Defined in
   `docs/architecture/engine/primitive-implementation-contract.md`.

2. EntityRef and relationship-layer contract.
   Stable entity forms, branch/space/version meaning, graph node binding,
   dangling references, temporal references, reverse maps, and search
   provenance.

3. Engine storage-space ID registry.
   Engine-owned byte assignments for KV, JSON, event, vector, graph, search,
   control-plane, shadow, and relationship rows.

4. Engine persistence adapter contract.
   The only normal storage-facing engine surface: physical key construction,
   latest/version/timestamp/history reads, commit batches, branch mechanics,
   timeline resolution, snapshot/recovery facts, and error mapping.

5. Branch operation and capability branch-adapter contract.
   Branch create, branch-from-version, branch-from-time, compare, promote,
   copy, restore, delete, conflict strategies, derived-state cleanup, and
   per-capability behavior.

6. Temporal context and timeline resolver contract.
   Shared `version`, `as_of`, history, timestamp resolution, retained-history
   errors, tombstone/TTL handling, and temporal search limitations.

7. Control-plane layout contract.
   `_system_` branch and branch-local `_system_` space records for recipes,
   capability registry, storage-space registry, projection manifests,
   watermarks, derived-state status, provenance, and capability facts.

8. Retrieval and derived-state contract.
   Source coverage, recipe schema, BM25/vector/graph stages, temporal
   compatibility, stale indexes, autoembedding watermarks, rebuild/repair, and
   stats/provenance.

9. IPC and serializable command-boundary contract.
   Command DTOs, access mode, read-only write classification, local vs IPC
   handle reporting, structured errors, and transport-independent semantics.

10. Dataset clone artifact contract.
    `.strata` bundle shape, validation, checksums, provenance, branch/version
    metadata, derived-state rebuild markers, and partial-write cleanup.

11. Public API and CLI surface cleanup checklist.
    Remove or hide follower mode, public transaction sessions, legacy branch
    bundles, disk-backed cache, tags/notes, and manual maintenance paths.

12. Product-pathway conformance plan.
    End-to-end tests for the 39 pathways, mapped to the architecture buckets
    and storage/engine fault-injection layers.

## V1 Readiness Rule

For a feature to be V1-ready, it must satisfy all four conditions:

1. The product document says it is Required or intentionally Optional.
2. This support matrix gives it an architecture owner.
3. The relevant follow-up contract exists and names failures, diagnostics, and
   tests.
4. The implementation passes product-pathway tests without upper layers
   bypassing engine or storage learning data capability semantics.
