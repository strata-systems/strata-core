# Billion-Scale Roadmap v2 — Durable Performance to ~70% of RocksDB

Status: **draft for review** (2026-07-07). Supersedes the remaining open items of
`billion-scale-plan.md` (v1) as the organizing plan for durable-mode performance.
Change class: planning document. Owner: storage.

## Goal

Strata durable (Standard policy) at **67–70% of RocksDB-default throughput** on the
standing three-way benchmark (YCSB A/B/C, 10M × 1KB, zipfian, identical harness), with
**bounded write tails** (no multi-second stalls) and **honest memory** (RSS tracks the
declared budget). The last 25–30% is accepted as long-tail tuning (RocksDB has a decade
of it) and explicitly out of scope. Cache mode is already 2.5–3.8× ahead of RocksDB on
run phases and is not a target of this plan.

The comparison is apples-to-apples on durability: RocksDB-default writes its WAL
buffered (`sync=false`), which is Strata Standard's durability class. RocksDB-default
reads ride the OS page cache (8MB own block cache); its numbers are the *storage-engine
floor* on this hardware, not a tuned ceiling.

## Where we are (evidence base, 2026-07-07, dev box, /data2 nvme1)

| 10M × 1KB | Strata durable | RocksDB-default | gap | target (≈70%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Load (batch 1000) | 82–96K rows/s | 1.02M rows/s | ~11× | ≥700K |
| A (50r/50u) | 0.5–2.0K ops/s | 334K | 170–680× | ≥230K |
| B (95r/5u) | 4.3K | 404K | ~94× | ≥280K |
| C (read-only) | 3.7K | 425K | ~115× | ≥290K |
| C read p50 / p99 | 59µs / 3.3ms | 2.8µs / 4.4µs | 21× / 750× | ≤6µs / ≤20µs |
| A update max | 0.4–48s (run lottery) | 217µs | — | ≤50ms |

Contrast at 100K records (small scale, low debt): durable A 13K / B 605K / D 502K —
B and D within 1.5–1.7× of CACHE mode. **The 100× gap is a scale phenomenon, not an
engine-architecture phenomenon.** Cache mode at 10M (258K/1.05M/1.60M) proves the
engine layers above storage are sound; every missing order of magnitude lives in
storage's behavior when the dataset exceeds memtables and compaction debt is real.

## The gap model — four terms, in causal order

**T1 — Compaction throughput and shape (the keystone).** Ingest at 90MB/s × write-amp
needs ~0.5–1GB/s of sustained compaction; we run serialized, unbounded passes (~1µs/row
single lane; one L0→L1 pass rewrites GBs, ~50s). Consequences cascade into every other
term: debt piles up → graded pacing brakes writers toward the near-stop floor (the A
collapse and the 0.4–48s run lottery on the L0 wall); L0/Ln table counts stay high →
read probes fan out and tails blow up (the C p99 3.3ms); tables-at-close stay high →
reopen floor. v1 (BS1–BS5) never targeted compaction throughput — it fixed concurrency,
lock hygiene, GC wiring, and admission semantics around it.

**T2 — Read path at scale.** p50 59µs vs page-cache-warm ~3µs: multi-source probe
fan-out (active + frozen + L0 count + level per level), block fetch through a cold/
mis-utilized block cache (raw-bytes cache, decode on every fetch; nothing warms it at
load; the OS page cache is evicted by our own 10× longer write phase), no readahead for
scans (E: 8.8× even at small scale). BS6 reserved this ground; it starts here with
attribution rather than assumptions.

**T3 — Per-commit write overhead.** Standard single-put commit ≈ 28µs (BS5.3
decomposition: apply 7.4, WAL append 3.5, admit 2.3, stage 1.7, plus clones, publish,
post-commit) versus RocksDB's ~3µs buffered write. Two structural multipliers of ours:
every commit carries **2 timeline rows** (a 3× row count on single-put commits), and the
group-commit machinery's fixed costs don't amortize for a solo writer. Ceiling today
~35K/s; target ~150–200K/s.

**T4 — Memory honesty.** The both-mode bench OOM-killed at 60.4GB anon RSS under a
declared 32g budget (jemalloc retention + unaccounted working sets: WAL encode buffers,
compaction merge buffers, reader metadata churn). The budget is the product's
Pi-Zero-to-server scaling contract; RSS must track it or every deployment story breaks.

## Workstreams

### W1 — Compaction engine (T1) — the majority of the gap

- **W1.1 Bounded incremental L0→L1 passes.** Cap per-pass input bytes; consume L0
  oldest-first prefixes so partial consumption preserves recency ordering; publish uses
  the existing candidate revalidation. Exit: L0-blocking relief ≤ 2s at 10M; workload A
  max ≤ 500ms across 5 consecutive runs (kills the run lottery).
- **W1.2 Parallel compaction lanes + subcompactions.** Key-range-partitioned
  subcompactions within a pass; concurrent non-overlapping level pairs across lanes
  (the per-branch guard structure already permits it; the off-lock Build machinery
  already runs builds without the runtime lock). Exit: sustained compaction throughput
  ≥ 600MB/s on the dev box; debt stabilizes (not merely grows slower) under a sustained
  100MB/s ingest.
- **W1.3 Leveled-shape targets at scale.** Re-derive level targets/growth for ≥10GB
  datasets (256MiB base × 10 growth is v1-era); verify write-amp ≤ ~12 measured; L0+L1
  table-count steady-state bounds that keep read fan-out ≤ ~8 sources.
- **W1.4 Pacing re-calibration on top.** With debt controllable, re-tune the graded
  ramp floor/knee so steady-state ingest ≈ compaction capacity (writer paces at the
  sustainable rate instead of oscillating between full speed and near-stop).
  Exit: load-seq ≥ 400K rows/s at 10M (stretch 700K with W3's WAL batching).

### W2 — Read path at scale (T2)

**W2.0 attribution DONE (2026-07-07 night, post-W1 shape, perf-trace read probes in
`engine-ycsb --perf-breakdown`).** Per-read anatomy of durable C (100K zipfian point
reads over 10M×1KB, p50 62.4µs / p99 927µs):

| component | measured (per read) | cost |
|---|---|---|
| table seeks | 3.63 (1 memtable + 1.62 L0 + ~1 winning Ln; 5.05 level searches) | index-only for losers — **no bloom filters: all filter counters are 0** |
| lazy block scan | 1.02 scans × **254.5 encoded entry headers walked** (no early exit — full-block walk) | ≈ the 62µs p50 (254 × ~240ns) |
| cache miss | 0.33 × **279KB** block read | ≈ the 927µs p99 (NVMe + compaction I/O interference) |
| row decode + clone | 1 row, 1.2KB | small |

Two root causes, both already half-solved in the tree:
1. **Blocks are ~256 rows ≈ 280KB, not the declared 64KB**: `append_streaming_row`
   cuts only on `rows_per_block == 256`; `target_data_block_size` (64KB) is passed
   down but never gates the cut. 4.3× oversized blocks inflate BOTH the p50 (entry
   walk) and the p99 (per-miss I/O). No format break to fix — blocks are
   length-framed, readers handle any size.
2. **Bloom filters exist but ship dark** (BS4.3 `filter_bits_per_key: None`
   config-gate, "until a later slice flips it on") — 2.6 of 3.63 seeks/read are
   losers a filter would skip; B pays 6.04 seeks/read (3.5 L0 probes from its flush
   backlog).

Cache hit rate 69.7% (C) / 90.7% (B) is CHURN-limited, not capacity-limited (whole
10GB dataset < 15GiB pool; 116 background rewrites completed during C's 14s run kill
identity-keyed cached blocks). Read I/O counters conflate lookup misses with
compaction reads (cursor_rows 1.77M in C) — split them before trusting absolute MB.

Revised slices (ranked by measured leverage):
- **W2.1 Enforce the data-block byte target — LANDED.** Cut on estimated bytes ≥
  target OR rows, whichever first (`append_streaming_row`); testkit builder model
  simulates the same rule. Measured at 10M durable: C read p50 **62.4 → 29.2µs**
  (walk 254 → 58.7 entries, per-miss I/O 279 → 64KB, exactly as predicted), C run
  6,953 → **11,272 ops/s**; load unchanged (98–113K); A unchanged (952, max 4.6s —
  W1.3a band). TRADE: B's floor dropped — post-W2.1 B = {5,037 / 2,982 / 2,077} vs
  {5,017 / 6,257} pre; the slow draws are L0-wall episodes (2.3–3.9s block_wait)
  that B did not previously hit, consistent with more per-block build work per
  window (same task counts, build wall-time varying 30–58s across identical runs).
  Read p50 on B's good draw: 52µs (was 134µs). Follow-up: block-size build-cost
  calibration (128KB compromise A/B, or shave per-block fixed costs in the
  build/read path) rides W1.4.
- **W2.2 Flip BS4.3 bloom filters on — LANDED.** Every lifecycle-driven build
  (flush + compaction) persists a 10-bits/key bloom filter
  (`lifecycle_table_builder_config`); the lazy point path's probe was already wired
  (losers short-circuit before index descent) and is now perf-trace counted.
  Measured at 10M durable: **B 5,158 ops/s, zero wall episodes, read p50 31µs**
  (was 52–134µs across the lottery), update p99 175µs (was 950µs–77ms); **A 1,696
  ops/s — the best A on record** (was 952–1,036), read p50 43.9µs (was 255µs). The
  win is L0-probe absorption: 554K–2.3M negative probes per run; B's block-scans
  per read fell 15.7 → 0.87. C unchanged by design — its loser probes die at the
  min/max range check before the filter (1.05 filter probes/read), and its run
  throughput remains cache-miss/churn-bound (W2.4). Follow-up W2.2b:
  materialization + snapshot-install builds still unfiltered (reader treats as
  `Unavailable`).
- **W2.3 Intra-block bisection — LANDED (B3, `b36d0c04`).** Derived per-block
  entry-offset accelerator (no format change; Accelerator cache kind): trusted
  seeks bisect instead of walking ~57 entries. Settled C interleaved A/B:
  **read p50 21.2 → 9.8µs (−54%)**, run +24% (16.5K median). Self-healing,
  equivalence-property-pinned, fuzzed.
- **W2.4 Block cache churn survival — LANDED.** Publish-time write-through:
  `warm_data_blocks_from_encoded` slices the just-encoded block frames inside the
  publish hook (rewrite sink + flush prepare, while the W1.2c sink still holds the
  bytes) and admits them via `insert_if_free` — NO-EVICT inserts only, so unproven
  fresh blocks never displace demand-cached ones; when the pool is smaller than the
  write rate's working set the warming degrades to a no-op (`SkippedFull`,
  scale-safe by construction). Measured at 10M durable: **tail collapse** — C read
  p99 704 → **430µs** (p99.9 2.28 → 1.17ms) at **11,455 ops/s** (campaign best,
  +51% over the W2.2 draw); A read p99 2.23ms → 827µs; B read p99 1.60ms → 807µs;
  throughputs within lottery elsewhere. Skip counters confirm the gate (34K–382K
  SkippedFull under churn). Pool now actually fills (+2GB allocated, within
  budget). Notes: blended hit-rate metric is compaction-cursor-contaminated (split
  in W6); two low load draws (80–87K) recorded for the W1.4 calibration. W2.4b:
  heat-aware admission (carry input-block heat to outputs) when pool << dataset.
- **W2.5 Scan readahead (BS6 item).** Auto-ramping readahead 8→256KB; fixes E and
  scan-range cells.
- **W2.6 (B2) Data-block size — LANDED.** Per-database knob + swept at 10M:
  **default flipped 64→16 KiB** (C +22%, p99 434→296µs stable, B +20-34%, A
  parity, miss IO ÷3). Subsumed W2.1b (#72).
- Exit: C ≥ 290K ops/s warm (p50 ≤ 6µs, p99 ≤ 20µs); B ≥ 280K; E within 3× of RocksDB.

### W1.4 — pacing calibration (LANDED)

Full attribution + fix chain in the ledger (2026-07-08 row): pacing was 76% of
workload A's wall; `pacing_debt` (budget/8 soft limit on structural overage) +
proportional-quadratic L0-depth rate controller replaced the multiplicative walk.
A 746–1,696 → ~3,000; B → 5,903 (best, zero delays); walls unchanged. Saturation
cell (4T) required before PR.

### W3 — Per-commit write overhead (T3)

- **W3.1 Timeline-row cost.** Single-put commits currently write 3 rows; either encode
  timeline facts into the commit record (no extra memtable rows) or batch/elide with
  exactness preserved for time-travel. This alone is ~2× on single-put workloads.
- **W3.2 Solo-writer fast path.** One uncontended path from API to WAL append + apply:
  skip group formation bookkeeping, cache admission verdicts (O(1) re-check), reuse
  encode buffers; target ≤ 8µs solo commit.
- **W3.3 Standard WAL write coalescing** (recorded v1 lever): buffered appends with
  group flush for concurrent writers.
- Exit: single-writer Standard ≥ 150K single-put commits/s at low debt; A ≥ 230K with
  W1+W2 in place (A is 50% reads — it needs both).

### W4 — Memory honesty (T4)

- **W4.1 RSS attribution** at 10M sustained load: accounted pools vs RSS; jemalloc
  decay/retention tuning (`background_threads`, decay ms); unaccounted structures
  charged or bounded (WAL encode buffers, merge working sets, snapshot clones).
- **W4.2 Budget contract test**: a standing gate that RSS ≤ declared budget × 1.25 at
  steady state on the 10M cell. Exit: three-way runs per-mode within budget; the
  both-mode OOM scenario impossible at spec'd headroom.

### W5 — Reopen & close hygiene (mostly landed; finish line)

- Replay probe landed (365→52µs/row). Remaining: checkpoint cadence at close (the
  0–1.5M-row tail lottery — tie checkpoint triggers to WAL bytes with a close-time
  flush-watermark push), and the O(tables) open floor (rides W1.3's table-count bounds).
- Exit: reopen at 10M ≤ 5s cold after a clean close; ≤ 30s after crash at max tail.

### W6 — Instrument & gates (continuous)

- The three-way (per-mode processes) is the standing scoreboard; every W-slice lands
  with its cell's before/after at 10M.
- Saturation cells (4T per-writer; sustained-load soak ≥ 10 min) run on every
  admission/pacing/compaction change — they caught 5 of this cycle's 7 defects.
- Stack-sampling profile REQUIRED for any attribution driving a slice design (counters
  misled twice this cycle).
- RSS tracked on every bench row.

## Sequencing

```text
M-A (compaction core):   W1.1 → W1.2 → W1.3 → W1.4     (largest, first, gates all)
M-B (read path):         W2.1 → W2.2/W2.3 (parallel) → W2.4   (starts after W1.2)
M-C (write overhead):    W3.1 → W3.2 → W3.3            (independent; can interleave)
M-D (memory):            W4.1 → W4.2                    (parallel with M-B)
M-E (reopen finish):     W5                             (small; after M-A)
```

Milestone exits are measured, not calendared. Rough shape: M-A alone should take
durable A from ~1K to ≥ 30K (tails bounded, pacing sane) and C from 3.7K to ~30–60K
(fan-out + debt tails); M-B and M-C together carry the rest of the way to the 70% line.

## 100M smoke findings (2026-07-07, post-plan; folded into workstreams)

The 100M×64B l9 ladder (standard, default budget) completed with zero admission aborts
(the Ln/watchdog fixes hold). Beyond amplified T1/T2 (load ~70K rows/s with 173s of
admission block-wait; scan-prefix p50 2.94ms with cursor SETUP taking 28.4s of the 30.9s
scan phase and 128× row-decode amplification), it exposed:

- **N1 — Level-shape pathology (folds into W1.3, upgraded):** post-load shape
  `L1=14, L2=3, L3/L4 empty, L5=41, L6=39, L7=750` — a 750-table bottommost level with
  holes mid-cascade; selected bytes 15.3GB vs 11.5GB targets. The level-target
  derivation misbehaves at 100M. W1.3 is now a required (not tuning) slice.
- **N2 — Fork scans rows (NEW, added as W5.2):** branch-fork p50 595ms at 100M (87ms at
  10M) with **40M rows visited across 100 forks** (~400K rows/fork) through the scan
  path. Fork is contractually O(1) metadata; something in the fork path scans
  proportionally to data. Attribution + fix before the 1B tier (at 1B this is a
  multi-second fork).
- **N3 — Reopen reader-count ≈ 100× live tables (attribution needed, W5.3):** reopen
  153s with **87,617 reader opens** against ~870 live tables at close, zero replay —
  the manifest/catalog appears to carry two orders of magnitude more table refs than
  live state (or recovery re-opens per reference). Close also took 89.5s. Both need
  stack-level attribution.

RSS observed ~16GB under the default (512MiB-class) budget mid-load — T4's standing
number at 100M (task #59).

## Non-goals (this plan)

- Beating RocksDB-default (the 67–70% line is the bar; parity is tuning-era work).
- Cache-mode performance (already ahead; only W4 touches it).
- `Always`-policy throughput (fsync-bound physics; group amortization landed in v1).
- SkipMap/concurrent memtable (stays parked: T3's fast path attacks fixed overhead
  first; revisit only if multi-writer scaling re-emerges as the bottleneck after M-C).
- Compression, tiered storage, 100M+ tiers (follow after the 10M line is held; the
  same workstreams re-run at 100M as v2.1).

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| W1.1 partial L0 consumption breaks recency/version invariants | design doc + differential recovery oracle + fault sweeps before merge-path changes; rows are (key,version)-keyed — correctness argument documented per slice |
| Parallel lanes reintroduce lock contention (BS5 territory) | builds already off-lock; lanes coordinate via the existing rewrite-conflict check; saturation cells gate every slice |
| Decoded cache breaks budget accounting (BS4.5a seams) | charge decoded entries to the block-cache pool; W4.2's RSS gate backstops |
| Timeline elision breaks time-travel semantics | engine-level product pathway tests are the gate (`product_pathways`); exactness is non-negotiable, only representation changes |
| Attribution wrong again | W6: stacks before slices, control-first A/B, medians of 3+, per-mode processes |
