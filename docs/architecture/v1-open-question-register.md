# V1 Open Question Register

Status: M0B decision ownership register

## Purpose

This register consolidates load-bearing open questions from the active V1
architecture and product documents.

It does not answer every implementation detail up front. Its job is to make
sure no stable crate construction depends on an unowned decision. Every question
that can affect crate boundaries, durable bytes, product semantics, public APIs,
or conformance gates has an owner and a closure point.

## Closure Rules

1. **Closed** means the V1 baseline is already decided in the architecture
   documents.
2. **Milestone-owned** means the named milestone or epic must close the question
   before its exit gate.
3. **Precondition** means a later milestone may not begin the named work until
   the question is closed.
4. **Post-V1** means the question is intentionally outside V1 implementation.
   V1 may preserve substrate hooks, but must not build the product feature.
5. **Implementation-local** means the milestone may choose exact Rust names or
   private shapes without reopening architecture, as long as the public
   contract and tests match the target docs.

## Register

| ID | Source | Question group | Owner | Closure point | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `V1Q-001` | `strata-v1-implementation-roadmap.md` | Core public surface. | `M1B`, `M1D` | Before M1 exit. | Closed baseline: core starts with `BranchId`, `CommitVersion`, timestamp representation, and type-local validation errors. `Value` and `EntityRef` move to engine; transaction/runtime IDs move to storage. |
| `V1Q-002` | Roadmap, storage L3/L5/L6/L7/L9, format spec | Durable storage bytes, including manifest, WAL, table, snapshot, row-key, and commit payload encoding. | `M3C`, `M3TA` | `M3C` must close before `M3D` or `M3E` use durable bytes. | Milestone-owned. Format spec remains draft until M3 golden vectors freeze it. |
| `V1Q-003` | Roadmap, storage target crate shape, storage testing plan | Storage test harness names, feature gates, and manual invocation. | `M2D`, `M2E`, `M2TB`, `M2TD` | Before M3 fault/golden/conformance harnesses depend on the testkit. | Milestone-owned. |

| `V1Q-005` | Roadmap, cutover plan | Exact cutover PR series, crate renames, dependency cuts, retirement guards, and promotion sequence. | `M10G` | `M10G` closes before `M10B` crate rename work. | Milestone-owned. |
| `V1Q-006` | Storage architecture, L2, core | Identifier and encoding ownership between core and storage. | `M1B`, `M1C`, `M3B` | Core atom encodings close in M1; storage object/path encodings close in M3B. | Milestone-owned. |
| `V1Q-007` | Storage L1, storage architecture | Backend capability vocabulary, conditional create/update shape, fence token vocabulary, list consistency, range-read requirements, and cache object-name validation. | `M2B`, `M3A`, `M3TE` | Capability vocabulary closes before M3 backend operations are treated as durable substrate. | Milestone-owned. Future object/OpenDAL details remain post-V1 unless explicitly pulled forward. |
| `V1Q-008` | Storage L2 | Object layout details: manifest history, branch/table manifest split, checksum-vs-ID object names, table ID addressing, snapshot ID shape, object-store prefix partitioning, human-readable local names, table generation, temp object scope, and quarantine metadata. | `M3B`, `M3D`, `M3E`, `M3TC` | V1 durable-local object naming decisions close before M3 durable services write durable object names. Object-store prefix partitioning is post-V1 unless explicitly pulled forward. | Milestone-owned. Version-prefix and global quarantine placement are closed baselines. |

## M0B Closure

M0B is closed when:

1. Every active V1 open-question section maps to at least one `V1Q-*` row.
2. Every `V1Q-*` row has an owner and closure point.
3. The roadmap points to this register instead of carrying unowned
   "remaining" items.
4. Placeholder documents remain allowed only when their owner milestone is
   listed in this register or in `docs/architecture/v1-document-inventory.md`.

At M0B capture time, no load-bearing V1 architecture question is unowned.
