# V1 Document Inventory

Status: M0A document inventory

## Purpose

This document records the architecture, product, specification, evidence, and
implementation-planning documents that make up the V1 rewrite reading path.

It is an inventory, not a replacement for the documents it lists. M0A uses this
file to close one question before implementation starts: every required
document either exists, is explicitly historical evidence, or is assigned to a
later milestone.

## Inventory Rules

1. Binding documents define V1 product, architecture, contracts, specs, or
   implementation order.
2. Evidence documents describe the current codebase or completed cleanup work.
   They are useful for implementation, but target architecture documents win
   when there is a conflict.
3. Historical documents are not target architecture. They may explain why the
   codebase looks the way it does.
4. Placeholder documents are intentionally present but incomplete. Their owner
   milestone must be named.
5. Deferred documents are not required before the next milestone starts.

## Current-Code Evidence

These documents remain useful evidence for implementation and reviews. They are
not binding V1 target architecture when they conflict with the V1 architecture
anchors.

| Document | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/core/core-charter.md` | Exists | Current/historical core scope evidence. |
| `docs/core/core-crate-map.md` | Exists | Current core crate map evidence. |
| `docs/storage/storage-charter.md` | Exists | Current storage scope evidence. |
| `docs/storage/storage-crate-map.md` | Exists | Current storage crate map evidence. |
| `docs/storage/v1-storage-consumption-contract.md` | Exists | Current consolidated engine/storage boundary evidence. |
| `docs/storage/storage-engine-ownership-audit.md` | Exists | Current ownership audit evidence. |
| `docs/storage/concurrency-crate-map.md` | Exists | Historical lower-runtime crate map evidence. |
| `docs/storage/durability-crate-map.md` | Exists | Historical lower-runtime crate map evidence. |
| `docs/engine/engine-consolidation-plan.md` | Exists | Active milestone-free consolidation closeout evidence. |
| `docs/engine/engine-crate-map.md` | Exists | Current engine crate map evidence. |
| `docs/engine/follower-mode-removal-plan.md` | Exists | Active current-code cleanup plan; V1 still removes follower mode. |
| `docs/core/archive/error-research.md` | Historical | Historical error-model research used as evidence by the V1 diagnostics contract. |
| `docs/core/archive/core-error-review.md` | Historical | Historical core error ownership review used as evidence by the V1 diagnostics contract. |
| `docs/engine/archive/engine-error-architecture.md` | Historical | Historical engine error architecture used as evidence by the V1 diagnostics contract. |

## Audits

| Document | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/audits/llama-ffi-unsafe-audit.md` | Placeholder | M7E-owned unsafe audit required before local llama.cpp runtime is V1-ready. |

## Historical Documents

| Document | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/architecture/next-charter.md` | Historical | Superseded original next-generation charter. Not binding for V1. |
| `docs/core/archive/` | Historical archive | Core cleanup-era plans and reviews. |
| `docs/storage/archive/` | Historical archive | Storage cleanup-era implementation plans. |
| `docs/engine/archive/` | Historical archive | Engine/storage cleanup-era plans and closeout records. |

## Explicit Deferrals

| Missing or incomplete document | Owner | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Final public API and CLI implementation detail beyond M9 | `M9` | Deferred to M9 slices; M9 plan is sufficient for M0A. |
| Completed cutover PR sequence | `M9G` | Placeholder exists at `docs/architecture/v1-cutover-pr-series.md`. |
| Completed llama.cpp unsafe audit | `M7E` | Placeholder exists at `docs/audits/llama-ffi-unsafe-audit.md`. |
| Stable storage format compatibility promise | `M3` | Draft spec exists; M3 freezes golden vectors and byte compatibility. |
| StrataHub sync and fleet-management implementation plans | Post-V1 | Substrate architecture exists; sync and fleet management are not V1 implementation blockers. |

## M0A Closure

M0A is closed when:

1. Every document listed as `Exists` is present in the repository.
2. `docs/architecture/next-charter.md` is clearly marked historical.
3. Placeholder and deferred documents have named owners.
4. Active non-archive V1 docs have no referenced documents missing from this
   inventory.
5. Active V1 docs can refer to this inventory instead of relying on memory.

At M0A capture time, no binding V1 architecture or contract document is missing.
