# Strata V1 Testing And Conformance Plan

Status: current — describes shipped 1.2.x behaviour (#3134)

## Purpose

Strata V1 should be built around a reference-grade testing culture. Storage is
the foundation of that effort. If storage cannot be tested deterministically at
each layer, the higher product promises around branching, time travel, recovery,
IPC, search, graph relationships, vectors, and Strata AI will never be reliable.

This document is the top-level testing plan. It identifies the test families
Strata must build, then walks the storage L1-L9 architecture layer by
layer and records what each layer must prove.

Layer-specific test specs can be written later. This document defines the first
shared map.

## Related Documents

2. `docs/architecture/storage-architecture.md`
3. `docs/architecture/storage/README.md`
4. `docs/architecture/storage/implementation-patterns.md`
5. `docs/architecture/v1-error-and-diagnostics-contract.md`
6. `docs/architecture/runtime-resource-profile-architecture.md`
7. `docs/product/strata-v1-non-functional-requirements.md`

## Goals

1. Make testability a design requirement, not an implementation afterthought.
2. Test storage layer contracts directly before engine behavior depends on
   them.
3. Use deterministic fault injection for every important failure window.
4. Use fuzzing for byte formats, parsers, codecs, command payloads, recovery
   inputs, and cursor state machines.
5. Use crash-recovery tests for every durable state transition.
6. Use backend conformance tests so local filesystem, cache/browser, and future
   object/OpenDAL backends obey the same contract where applicable.
7. Assert stable error codes, classes, retry policy, and commit outcomes rather
   than prose messages.
8. Keep product semantics out of storage tests unless the test is explicitly an
   engine or product-path test.
9. Build reusable harnesses instead of one-off fixtures per feature.
10. Keep the memory/cache backend compiling and passing on
    `wasm32-unknown-unknown` so browser/cache substrate support does not become
    a retrofit.
11. Prove runtime resource profiles with fake host probes and resolved-budget
    assertions so one binary remains safe across edge, desktop, and server
    envelopes.

## Non-Goals

1. This document does not define exact Rust test module names.
2. This document does not require all test families to exist before the first
   storage implementation begins.
3. This document does not define benchmark thresholds.
4. This document does not specify a particular fuzzing framework.
5. This document does not require production OpenDAL or S3 durable mode for V1.
6. This document does not turn storage tests into engine primitive tests.

Performance regression benchmarks remain binding where CLAUDE.md or the current
project rules require them. This plan does not redefine thresholds; a benchmark
plan should rederive storage thresholds once the new architecture exists.

Engine-next product-path tests are out of scope until the engine
architecture exists. This plan covers storage conformance and identifies
where engine should later add product-path tests over L9.

## Test Taxonomy

Strata should use a small set of repeatable test families.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests prove local invariants for one type, module, or service:

1. Constructor validation.
2. Boundary conditions.
3. Error classification.
4. Redaction.
5. Source-chain preservation.
6. Ordering and comparison invariants.
7. No accidental defaulting of impossible states.

### Property Tests

Property tests generate many valid and invalid states for stable invariants:

1. Object-name round trips.
2. Durable-format encode/decode round trips.
3. Internal-key ordering.
4. Cursor movement.
5. Table compaction equivalence.
6. Branch visibility across inherited layers.
7. Commit ordering and version monotonicity.
8. Retention and tombstone behavior.

### Golden-Vector Tests

Golden vectors freeze stable durable bytes and public wire shapes:

1. WAL segment and record bytes.
2. Commit payload bytes.
3. Manifest bytes.
4. Snapshot envelope bytes.
5. Table header/footer/block/entry bytes.
6. Command boundary error status bytes once the protocol is defined.

Golden vector regeneration must be explicit. Normal tests must never update
goldens incidentally.

### Fuzz Tests

Fuzz tests target untrusted or durable input:

1. Format decoders.
2. Compression and encryption frames.
3. Manifest decoders.
4. WAL readers.
5. Snapshot readers.
6. Table readers and cursors.
7. Recovery input ordering.
8. Object-name parsers.
9. Command and IPC payloads.
10. Import/export formats.

Fuzz targets must prove:

1. No panic.
2. No unbounded allocation from attacker-controlled lengths.
3. No successful decode with unconsumed bytes unless explicitly supported.
4. No success after checksum or authentication failure.
5. Deterministic typed errors for invalid input.

### Backend Conformance Tests

Backend conformance tests prove every backend implements the same L1 contract
for the capabilities it claims.

Required backends for the first storage implementation:

1. Memory/cache backend.
2. Local filesystem backend.

Architecture-aware future backend:

1. OpenDAL/object backend.

An unfinished backend may exist only if it reports capabilities honestly and
fails unsupported modes before side effects.

The memory/cache backend must compile and pass its non-durable conformance
tests on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Durable browser persistence is not required
for the first storage rewrite.

### Fault-Injection Tests

Fault injection tests simulate failures at explicit layer boundaries:

1. Backend read/write/delete/list failures.
2. Partial writes.
3. Stale metadata or fencing tokens.
4. Permission failures.
5. Sync/fsync failures.
6. Publish failure before visibility.
7. Publish failure after possible visibility.
8. WAL append failures.
9. Manifest publish failures.
10. Snapshot publish failures.
11. Table publish failures.
12. IPC disconnects during write.
13. Provider timeouts and invalid responses.

Fault injection should be deterministic. Randomized failure schedules can be
added after deterministic cases exist.

### Crash-Recovery Tests

Crash-recovery tests should simulate process death between durable state
transitions:

1. Before WAL append.
2. During WAL append.
3. After WAL append before visible apply.
4. After visible apply before manifest update.
5. During manifest publish.
6. After manifest publish before namespace durability confirmation.
7. During snapshot publish.
8. During table publish.
9. During WAL truncation.
10. During retention or quarantine operations.
11. During shutdown.

Each crash test should reopen the database and assert durable state, visible
state, recovery health, error status, and absence of orphaned visible data.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests prove layers compose correctly:

1. L1-L4 durable services over local filesystem.
2. L4-L7 write path with WAL-before-visible.
3. L5-L6 reads over mutable, frozen, immutable, and inherited tables.
4. L7-L8 recovery replay and allocator catch-up.
5. L8-L9 open, close, maintenance, health, and fault hook behavior.
6. Engine-next product pathways over the L9 boundary.

Integration tests should still use storage-shaped rows unless they are
explicitly engine product tests.

### Long-Running And Randomized Tests

Long-running tests exercise state-space combinations:

1. Mixed puts, tombstones, forks, materializations, retention, and compaction.
2. Crash schedules across many commits.
3. Recovery after repeated checkpoint/WAL truncation cycles.
4. Branch inheritance and deletion under maintenance pressure.
5. Cache pressure and table read concurrency.
6. Engine product workflows combining branches, time travel, graph
   relationships, vectors, search, and events.

These tests are not a substitute for deterministic fault cases. They catch
interactions after the base contracts are already specified.

## Required Test Infrastructure

The first storage implementation should build test infrastructure early.

### Testkit Crate Or Module

Storage-next should have a reusable testkit for:

1. Backend conformance.
2. Faulting backend wrapper.
3. Durable publisher fault windows.
4. Crash-point orchestration.
5. Golden-vector fixture loading.
6. Storage-row generators.
7. Branch/table state generators.
8. Recovery-state builders.
9. Error-status assertions.
10. Redaction assertions.

The exact crate/module placement can be decided during implementation. The key
requirement is that tests reuse harnesses instead of building bespoke fixtures.

### Fault Backend

The fault backend must be able to fail:

1. Read.
2. Range read.
3. Write.
4. Conditional create.
5. Conditional update.
6. Delete.
7. List.
8. Metadata read.
9. Durable sync where supported.
10. Namespace/directory sync where supported.

It should support failure by operation count, object role, object name, phase,
and injected error class.

### Crash Harness

The crash harness should support two levels:

1. In-process deterministic interruption for fast layer tests.
2. Process-level kill/reopen tests for durable local filesystem confidence.

Process-level tests are slower and should be targeted. In-process tests should
cover the full failure matrix first.

### Concurrency Harness

L7 commit ordering, branch commit guards, maintenance quiescing, and close
ordering need deterministic concurrency tests.

The implementation must choose a concurrency-testing approach before L7 freezes.
Acceptable first choices are:

1. A hand-rolled deterministic scheduler for storage-owned tasks.
2. `loom`.
3. `shuttle`.

The choice should be recorded in the L7 implementation plan. Until then,
ordinary thread races are useful stress coverage but are not sufficient as the
only proof of lock ordering or commit interleavings.

### Error Assertions

All failure tests should assert:

1. Error class.
2. Error code.
3. Retry policy.
4. Commit outcome.
5. Source chain presence where applicable.
6. Redaction.
7. Recovery health facts when applicable.

Tests should not assert prose messages unless the test is specifically about
human-facing CLI or documentation output.

## Storage Layer Test Plan

### L1 Backend IO

L1 proves Strata can depend on backend capabilities honestly.

Conformance tests:

1. Write and read full object.
2. Read byte ranges.
3. Delete object.
4. List by prefix.
5. Metadata changes after write.
6. Conditional create succeeds once and fails on existing object.
7. Conditional update fails with stale metadata or fence.
8. Unsupported operations return unsupported, not success.
9. Capability mismatch is detected before higher layers run.
10. Object names are treated as opaque validated names from L2.

Fault tests:

1. Failed read.
2. Failed range read.
3. Failed write.
4. Failed delete.
5. Failed list.
6. Partial write where the backend can simulate it.
7. Stale metadata.
8. Precondition failure.
9. Permission failure.
10. Transient unavailable.

Backend matrix:

| Backend | Required tests |
| --- | --- |
| Memory/cache | Non-durable conformance and fault tests, no crash durability claim. |
| Local filesystem | Full durable conformance, sync/fencing behavior, process-level crash tests where relevant. |
| Future OpenDAL/object | Capability declaration, unsupported-mode rejection, object semantics conformance for claimed capabilities. |

Acceptance criteria:

1. Every backend declares capabilities.
2. Unsupported durable modes fail before side effects.
3. Backend errors carry storage-local classifications.
4. Local filesystem is the reference durable backend.

### L2 Object Layout

L2 proves all storage object names are validated and namespace-safe.

Unit tests:

1. Constructor rejects empty names.
2. Constructor rejects absolute paths.
3. Constructor rejects `..` and path escape.
4. Constructor rejects trailing slashes where not allowed.
5. Reserved prefixes cannot be used by the wrong object family.
6. Temporary, WAL, manifest, table, snapshot, quarantine, and lock objects use
   their reserved families.

2. Random invalid strings are rejected or normalized only through explicit
   constructors.

1. No upper storage layer constructs object names with raw string formatting.
2. L2 has no IO classification.
3. Object names do not carry a V1 namespace prefix by default.

2. Commit payload format.
3. Manifest format.
4. Snapshot container and section envelope.
5. Storage row encoding.
6. Internal key encoding.

5. Golden vectors change only through explicit fixture updates.

### L4 Log, Manifest, Snapshot, And Publish Services

2. Unsupported durable object-store mode fails before side effects.
3. Cache mode does not claim crash durability.
4. Local filesystem mode reports durable capability facts.
5. Raw open outcome includes recovery and capability facts.
6. Commit outcome includes version, timestamp, durability, conflict/stall, and

9. Read latest works through the boundary.
10. Read by version works through the boundary.
11. Timestamp-bounded read works through the boundary.
12. Prefix/range scan by visibility bound works through the boundary.
13. Per-key history works through the boundary.

   boundary.
15. Primitive-neutral checkpoint boundary does not require storage primitive
   knowledge.
16. Raw recovery outcome and health are exposed.
17. Maintenance drain/status/control hooks are exposed for engine/tests.
18. Safe close/shutdown works through the boundary.
19. Fault hooks are unavailable or inert in normal production builds.
20. Upper crates above engine cannot import storage in normal
   production code.

Error conformance tests:

1. Storage boundary errors expose storage-local categories.
2. Engine-next maps storage errors into product errors explicitly.
3. No storage error exposes JSON, graph, vector, search, recipe, IPC, or Strata
   AI semantics.
4. Error codes, retry policy, and commit outcomes match
   `v1-error-and-diagnostics-contract.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

1. L9 is the only normal production storage surface consumed by engine.
2. L9 hides lower-layer implementation detail unless it is a stable storage
   contract.
3. L9 has cache and local filesystem conformance suites.

## Cross-Layer Matrices

### Backend Matrix

| Test family | Memory/cache | Local filesystem | Future OpenDAL/object |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 conformance | Required | Required | Required for claimed capabilities |
| wasm32 cache conformance | Required for memory/cache | Not applicable | Not applicable until a wasm-capable adapter exists |
| L2 object names | Required | Required | Required |
| L3 formats | Required where bytes exist | Required | Required where bytes exist |
| L4 durable services | Non-durable facts only | Required | Unsupported-mode tests until durable mode exists |
| L5 table runtime | Required | Required | Required through object abstraction if implemented |
| L6 branch LSM | Required | Required | Required after backend supports needed object semantics |
| L7 commits | WAL-free non-durable | WAL-before-visible | Fail fast unless durable primitive exists |
| L8 recovery | No crash durability claim | Required | Deferred unless durable mode exists |
| L9 API | Required | Required | Unsupported-mode tests |

### Failure Matrix

Every storage layer should map failure tests to stable error facts.

| Failure family | Primary layers |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid object name | L2, L9 |
| Unsupported backend capability | L1, L4, L8, L9 |
| Backend read/write/list/delete failure | L1, L4, L5, L8, L9 |
| Publish before visibility failure | L4, L7, L8 |
| Publish after possible visibility failure | L4, L7, L8 |
| Durable sync failure | L1, L4, L7, L8 |
| Codec mismatch | L3, L4, L8 |
| WAL partial tail | L4, L8 |
| WAL corruption | L3, L4, L8 |
| Table corruption | L3, L5, L8 |
| Snapshot corruption | L3, L4, L8 |
| Retention proof incomplete | L6, L8 |
| Quarantine/reclaim failure | L8 |
| Commit conflict | L7, L9 |
| Durable-but-not-visible commit | L7, L8, L9 |
| Ambiguous commit | L4, L7, L9 |

### Test Maturity Levels

Each layer should move through maturity levels:

1. **T0 - Unit coverage.**
   Local constructors, invariants, and basic success/error cases exist.

2. **T1 - Conformance coverage.**
   The layer has reusable harnesses and multiple implementations or modes pass
   the same tests.

3. **T2 - Property coverage.**
   Generated valid states prove model equivalence and ordering invariants.

4. **T3 - Fault coverage.**
   Deterministic injected failures cover expected failure windows and error
   classification.

5. **T4 - Fuzz coverage.**
   Public decoders, parsers, and state machines survive untrusted inputs.

6. **T5 - Crash coverage.**
   Durable modes survive crash points and reopen with correct recovery facts.

7. **T6 - Long-running coverage.**
   Randomized and stress tests exercise interactions across layers and product
   pathways.

Not every layer needs every maturity level. L3 must reach T4 early. L4/L7/L8
must reach T5 before durable local filesystem can be considered V1-ready. L1,
L5, L6, and L9 require strong T1/T2 coverage and targeted T3/T4 coverage, but
they do not independently need process-level T5 crash suites unless they own a
durable publication boundary. L6 crash behavior is primarily exercised through
L7/L8 replay and recovery tests.

## CI Direction

Detailed CI policy belongs in a later implementation plan, but the testing
architecture expects these tiers:

1. Per-PR fast unit and conformance tests.
2. Per-PR memory/cache tests on native and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` once the
   storage crate exists.
3. Per-PR local filesystem storage conformance.
4. Nightly crash and stress tests.
5. Scheduled fuzzing.
6. Release-gate golden vector and format compatibility checks.

## Implementation Sequence

The first implementation sequence should be:

1. Build the storage testkit skeleton.
2. Build L1 backend conformance and fault backend harness.
3. Build L2 object-name property tests.
4. Build L3 golden-vector and fuzz harnesses before freezing durable bytes.
5. Build L4 durable publisher and WAL/manifest/snapshot fault-window tests.
6. Build L5 table model/property tests.
7. Build L6 branch visibility model/property tests.
8. Build L7 commit crash-point tests.
9. Build L8 recovery and maintenance deterministic executor tests.
10. Build L9 cache and local filesystem conformance suites.
11. Build resource-profile tests for embedded, desktop, server, unknown, and
    explicit-profile hosts.
12. After engine architecture exists, add engine product-path tests
    over L9.
13. Add long-running randomized tests after deterministic contracts are stable.

This sequence intentionally front-loads the harnesses. Without those harnesses,
later tests will become bespoke and brittle.

## What Moves Into Later Documents

Later detailed documents should define:

1. Exact backend conformance test names and fixtures.
2. Exact fault backend API.
3. Exact crash harness API.
4. Golden-vector generation and update procedure.
5. Fuzz target list and corpus strategy.
6. Layer-specific model implementations for property tests.
7. CI tiers and which tests run by default.
8. Slow/nightly/stress test policy.
9. Benchmarks and performance regression thresholds.
10. Product-path test matrix above engine.

## Acceptance Criteria

This top-level plan is sufficient when:

1. Every storage layer L1-L9 has a named test responsibility.
2. Fuzzing responsibilities are assigned to byte/parsing/state-machine layers.
3. Fault-injection responsibilities are assigned to backend, publish, commit,
   recovery, IPC, and provider boundaries.
4. Crash-recovery responsibilities are assigned to durable local filesystem
   paths and never claimed by cache mode.
5. Error tests are tied to the V1 error and diagnostics contract.
6. Test infrastructure is treated as a first-class implementation deliverable.
7. Engine-next can later add product-path tests without reaching around L9.
