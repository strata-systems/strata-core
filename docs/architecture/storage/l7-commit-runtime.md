# L7. Commit Runtime

Status: current — describes shipped 1.2.x behaviour (#3134)

Depends on:

- [L3. Durable Format / Codec](./l3-durable-format-codec.md)
- [L4. Log / Manifest / Snapshot Services](./l4-log-manifest-snapshot-services.md)
- [L6. Branch-Isolated LSM Runtime](./l6-branch-isolated-lsm-runtime.md)

Consumed by:

- L8. Lifecycle / Recovery / Maintenance
- [L9. Storage API Boundary](./l9-storage-api-boundary.md)
- engine, through storage's internal commit-batch API

## Purpose

L7 owns Strata's internal commit unit.

Storage-next should not expose public begin/commit/rollback transaction
sessions as a V1 product surface. Users should use product operations such as
get, set, put, delete, append, search, and branch operations. Storage still
needs a precise commit runtime so writes can be ordered, validated, made
durable, and made visible without corrupting branch-local LSM state.

L7 is that runtime.

## Core Decision

The storage write contract is an internal `CommitBatch`, not a public
transaction session.

The target shape is:

```text
engine builds semantic operation
  |
  v
storage CommitBatch
  branch target
  rows to put/delete
  expiry/write-mode metadata
  optional conflict facts
  |
  v
L7 validates, assigns version/timestamp, and orders commit
  |
  v
L4 appends durable commit record when durability requires WAL
  |
  v
L6 installs committed rows into branch-local state
  |
  v
L7 publishes commit visibility and returns CommitOutcome
```

This preserves the useful part of the current transaction system: one commit
version for all rows in a commit, read-your-writes when an internal operation
needs a staged view, optimistic conflict detection when requested, branch commit
guards, WAL-before-visible discipline, and visible-version tracking.

It removes the product assumption that users should manage long-lived storage
transactions directly.

## Responsibilities

L7 owns:

- internal commit-batch shape
- transaction/commit IDs where storage-local
- commit-version allocation
- commit timestamp allocation
- commit ordering
- commit visibility publication
- branch commit guards
- commit quiescing for checkpoint/fork/recovery safety
- branch-deletion commit barriers
- optional read-set and CAS conflict validation
- read-only commit fast path
- WAL-before-visible discipline through L4
- durable-but-not-visible classification
- atomic application of a committed batch into L6
- visible-version tracking
- lock-order rules for commit path locks
- storage-local commit metrics and commit facts needed by L8

L7 does not own:

- public user transaction commands
- product ACID claims
- engine data capability semantics
- JSON path semantics
- graph/vector/search/index side effects
- embedding or inference side effects
- product branch workflows such as merge, cherry-pick, revert, restore, or
  publish
- backend object naming
- WAL byte format
- table byte format
- branch-local LSM table layout
- checkpoint, compaction, retention, or repair scheduling
- multi-process or distributed consensus

## Layer Boundary

```text
L8 Lifecycle / Recovery / Maintenance
  schedules shutdown, checkpoint, replay, repair, and write gates
  |
  v
L7 Commit Runtime
  validates and orders commit batches
  assigns versions/timestamps
  writes durable commit records through L4
  applies committed rows through L6
  |
  +--> L4 Log / Manifest / Snapshot Services
  |      append WAL record envelope, apply standard/always durability policy
  |
  +--> L6 Branch-Isolated LSM Runtime
         install rows/tombstones into branch-local mutable state
```

L7 may call L4 and L6. L4 must not call L7. L6 must not call L7.

Engine-next should not import WAL records, `TransactionContext`, or branch-LSM
internals. It should submit semantic writes as storage commit batches.

## Current Code Evidence

The current implementation already contains most L7 mechanics, but they are
spread across storage and engine and are still named around public
transactions.

### Core L7 Evidence

- `crates/storage/src/txn/context.rs`: current staged write/read context,
  read-your-writes behavior, read set, delete set, CAS set, TTL map, write
  modes, transaction lifecycle, and apply summary.
- `crates/storage/src/txn/manager.rs`: storage-owned transaction manager,
  commit version allocation, retired transaction ID allocation evidence, branch
  commit locks, commit quiescing, visible-version tracking, pending-version
  tracking, branch deletion barriers, and no-WAL commit path.
- `crates/storage/src/txn/validation.rs`: read-set and CAS validation. Current
  semantics are snapshot isolation with first-committer-wins over read-set/CAS
  facts; blind writes do not conflict.
- `crates/storage/src/commit/guard.rs`: the commit-path lock order (documented in
  its module header) and the branch-admission / quiesce guard mutex.
  `crates/storage/src/commit/lock_order.rs` enforces that order under
  `debug_assertions` (a lock-rank tracker; #2636).
- `crates/storage/src/durability/commit_adapter.rs`: WAL-before-storage bridge.
  It serializes one commit payload, appends it to WAL when required, then lets
  the storage transaction manager apply rows.
- `crates/storage/src/durability/payload.rs`: current commit payload shape.
- `crates/storage/src/durability/format/wal_record.rs`: WAL record envelope and
  durable commit record shape.

### Boundary Evidence

- `crates/storage/src/traits.rs`: current storage trait exposes
  `apply_writes_atomic`, `put_with_version_mode`, `delete_with_version`, and
  version-bounded reads.
- `crates/storage/src/segmented/mod.rs`: current `apply_writes_atomic`,
  `apply_recovery_atomic`, version tracking, branch mutable-table insertion, and
  recovery-specific timestamp preservation. This file mixes L6 apply mechanics
  with L7 commit application and L8 recovery/lifecycle helpers.
- `crates/engine/src/coordinator.rs`: current engine transaction coordinator
  wraps storage's `TransactionManager` with active transaction metrics, timeout
  checks, GC-safe version tracking, and error conversion.
- `crates/engine/src/database/transaction.rs`: current database-level begin and
  commit orchestration, writer-health checks, generation guard validation,
  write backpressure, WAL selection, flush scheduling, and post-commit observer
  notification.
- `crates/engine/src/transaction/owned.rs` and `crates/engine/src/transaction/pool.rs`:
  current public/manual transaction handle and pooled `TransactionContext`.
  These are evidence for optimization and internal staging, not evidence that
  public transaction sessions should remain a product API.

## Target Concepts

L7 should use a small set of repeatable concepts.

### CommitBatch

`CommitBatch` is the internal write unit submitted to storage.

It should contain:

- target branch
- puts
- deletes
- expiry metadata, with zero meaning no expiry
- optional write-mode or retention hints
- optional expected read facts
- optional CAS facts
- optional operation origin for diagnostics

It should not contain:

- primitive DTOs
- JSON path operations
- graph edge/node semantics
- vector embedding semantics
- search indexing semantics
- user-facing transaction state
- WAL record bytes
- table object names

Engine-next may build a `CommitBatch` from one product operation or from a
small engine-internal operation group. The batch is the storage boundary.

### CommitRow

`CommitRow` is a storage-shaped row mutation.

It should contain:

- physical row key or storage key parts
- row value bytes or storage value
- mutation kind: put or tombstone
- expiry metadata, with zero meaning no expiry
- retention/write-mode hint if retained

L7 assigns version and timestamp to the row at commit time. Engine should not
pre-stamp rows with storage commit versions.

### CommitValidator

`CommitValidator` checks storage facts before versioned visibility.

Validation should include:

- commit batch is not malformed
- branch target is allowed to receive writes
- branch is not marked deleting
- row keys belong to the target branch unless the operation is explicitly
  storage-internal and cross-branch safe
- read facts still match current visible versions when optimistic validation is
  requested
- CAS facts still match current visible versions
- write-buffer limits and row-count limits are respected

The current read-set/CAS validation is useful and should be preserved as an
internal capability. It should not be marketed as full serializable
transactions. The current model allows write skew, and that is acceptable unless
the V1 product explicitly chooses a stronger claim.

### CommitGuard

`CommitGuard` represents the ordered locks held while a mutating commit is
being prepared, made durable, and applied.

The current lock order is a good starting point:

```text
1. commit quiesce read guard
2. per-branch commit mutex
3. deletion/reference barrier only where required by branch-table operations
4. WAL mutex
5. branch/table state guards
```

The target should keep this as an explicit storage contract. New locks should
be assigned a level before implementation.

### VersionClock

`VersionClock` owns commit-version allocation.

Rules:

1. Commit versions are monotonically increasing.
2. Commit versions do not need to be dense.
3. A failed pre-visible commit may leave a version gap.
4. A durable WAL record permanently reserves its commit version.
5. Recovery must advance the allocator above every recovered commit version.
6. Fork-version capture must use applied branch max version, not an
   allocated-but-unapplied global version.

The current code already treats version gaps as acceptable. For example, a
pre-apply hook failure can reserve a version and then return no visible rows.
Storage-next should either preserve version gaps deliberately or explicitly
design them away. It must not accidentally rely on dense version sequences.

### VisibleVersionTracker

`VisibleVersionTracker` publishes the highest version that readers may treat as
fully applied.

The current design has both storage's branch/global version facts and the
transaction manager's visible version. Storage-next should define this more
clearly:

- `allocated_version`: highest version reserved by L7
- `durable_version`: highest version known durable in WAL or equivalent
- `applied_version`: highest version applied to L6 branch state
- `visible_version`: highest version safe for new snapshots

The V1 implementation may collapse some of these if a backend does not need the
distinction, but failure handling must preserve the distinction between durable
and visible.

### CommitOutcome

`CommitOutcome` should return:

- commit version
- commit timestamp
- rows written
- rows deleted
- durable status
- visibility status
- branch target
- optional WAL object/segment facts for diagnostics

The outcome should be storage-shaped. Engine can convert it into product
responses and can run best-effort post-commit observers.

## Commit Batch Model

The target batch model should be single-branch by default:

```text
CommitBatch
  branch_id
  mutations
    Put(row_key, value, ttl, write_mode)
    Delete(row_key)
  validation
    ReadVersion(row_key, expected_version)
    CompareVersion(row_key, expected_version, new_value)
  options
    durability requirement
    conflict validation mode
    timestamp mode
```

Single-branch default keeps branch commit locking simple and matches the common
write path.

Cross-branch product operations should usually be represented as:

1. engine reads from source branches using L6/L9 versioned reads,
2. engine computes semantic result,
3. engine submits one target-branch commit batch.

If storage later needs a true multi-branch storage commit, it should be a
separate design with deterministic branch-lock ordering or a quiesce guard. It
should not appear accidentally because a caller passed rows from multiple
branches.

## Commit Protocol

### Read-Only Batch

Read-only work should not allocate a commit version.

Flow:

```text
validate batch has no mutations
return current visible version / read snapshot fact
```

Read-only work is usually better expressed as L6/L9 reads rather than L7
commits. The read-only fast path exists only for internal compatibility and
diagnostics.

### Cache / No-WAL Commit

Cache mode has no crash durability claim.

Flow:

```text
validate batch
acquire commit guard
allocate commit version and timestamp
apply rows atomically through L6
publish visible version
release guard
return CommitOutcome { durable: false, visible: true }
```

If L6 apply fails before visibility, the commit is aborted. Since no WAL exists,
there is no recovery obligation.

### Durable Local Commit

Durable local mode must write a commit record before making rows visible.

Flow:

```text
validate batch
acquire commit guard
allocate commit version and timestamp
encode commit payload through L3
append commit record through L4 according to the selected durable policy
apply rows atomically through L6
publish visible version
release guard
return CommitOutcome { durable: true, visible: true }
```

The WAL record is the durability point. L6 visibility comes after L4 reports
that the record is durable enough for the selected durable policy.

For V1, the selected durable policy is one of:

1. `standard`
   L4 has accepted the WAL record and the background or periodic durability
   policy is responsible for forcing it within the configured window.

2. `always`
   L4 has accepted the WAL record and forced the required durability barrier
   before L7 acknowledges the commit.

`cache` bypasses this path entirely. It is a WAL-free storage mode, not a
durable commit policy.

### Object Backend Candidate Commit

Object-backed durable commits are post-V1 unless explicitly scoped otherwise.

If added, L7 must not assume POSIX append, rename, file handles, or directory
fsync. It should depend on L4 capability declarations:

- appendable log or append-equivalent object log
- conditional create/update for commit fencing
- manifest fencing if append cannot be trusted
- documented list/read-after-write assumptions

If those capabilities are absent, durable open must fail before commit runtime
starts.

## WAL-Before-Visible Contract

L7 must not make a mutating durable commit visible until L4 has accepted the
commit record.

Rules:

1. L7 assigns version before WAL encode.
2. L3 encodes the commit payload.
3. L4 appends the WAL record and applies the selected `standard` or `always`
   durability policy.
4. Only after L4 succeeds may L7 call L6's apply operation.
5. Only after L6 apply succeeds may L7 publish visibility.

Crash outcomes:

- before WAL append succeeds: commit is not durable and must not become visible
- after WAL append succeeds, before visibility: commit is durable and must be
  replayed by L8 recovery
- after visibility, before table flush: commit is visible in memory and still
  recoverable from WAL
- after table flush and flush watermark publication: L8 may later make the WAL
  segment eligible for truncation

## Visibility And Snapshot Reads

New snapshots need a coherent visibility point.

The current implementation waits for `visible_version` to catch up to the
storage version before constructing normal transaction snapshots. That protects
readers from observing a version whose rows are not fully applied.

Storage-next should make the rule explicit:

1. A reader snapshot may target only a visible version.
2. L7 publishes visible version after L6 apply completes.
3. L6 read APIs use the requested visible version as the upper bound.
4. L8 recovery may restore visible version from recovered state, but only after
   replaying durable commits into L6.
5. A durable-but-not-visible commit must not be reported as visible to normal
   reads in the current process.

If storage keeps separate per-branch visible versions, L7 must define how
global reads and cross-branch operations choose a safe snapshot. If it keeps one
global visible version, it must preserve the current cross-branch safety
property without causing unnecessary stalls.

## Read-Your-Writes

Public transaction sessions are not a V1 product requirement, but some internal
engine operations still need a staged view while building a commit.

The target should separate two concepts:

1. `CommitBatch`: the final storage write unit submitted to L7.
2. `CommitDraft` or engine-owned semantic draft: an optional builder used while
   evaluating a product operation.

The staged view may support:

- read own put
- read own delete as missing
- scan overlay of staged rows over L6 snapshot reads
- read-set capture for validation when requested
- CAS fact capture

This builder should not become a public storage transaction session by default.
Engine-next can own product-specific staging when it needs semantic reads before
commit. L7 only needs the final batch and validation facts.

## Conflict Model

V1 should be honest about conflict guarantees.

The current model is snapshot isolation with first-committer-wins validation for
read-set and CAS facts:

- reads capture the version observed
- commit validates those versions against current storage
- CAS validates expected versions
- blind writes do not conflict
- write skew is allowed

This is a reasonable internal model. It is not a full serializable transaction
claim.

Storage-next should preserve the model unless product requirements explicitly
choose a different guarantee. If V1 removes public transaction commands, the
conflict model becomes an internal correctness mechanism, not a user-facing
feature.

## Branch Guards

L7 is responsible for preventing commits into branches that are unsafe to
mutate.

Required guards:

- per-branch commit lock for normal target-branch commits
- branch-deleting marker that rejects new commits
- branch generation guard if branch IDs can be reused after deletion/recreation
- commit quiesce guard for checkpoint, fork, recovery, and operations that need
  a stable version point
- explicit cross-branch permission for storage-internal operations that cannot
  be represented as one target-branch batch

Branch product semantics stay above storage. L7 should not know why a branch is
being deleted, merged, restored, or materialized. It only enforces storage
mutation safety.

## Commit Timestamps

Today, WAL commit records carry timestamps and normal storage apply paths stamp
rows at apply time. Recovery-specific paths preserve WAL timestamps.

Storage-next should tighten this:

1. L7 allocates one commit timestamp per commit.
2. L3 encodes that timestamp into the commit payload/WAL record.
3. L6 applies every row in that commit with the same commit timestamp.
4. L7 records the commit in a per-branch commit timeline.
5. L8 recovery replays the original timestamp and catches up the timeline.

This is necessary because product `as_of`, timeline scrub, and
branch-from-time are timestamp features rather than version aliases. Engine
owns the product selector and explanation; storage owns the generic
timestamp-to-version substrate.

The timeline is storage-native V1 substrate:

```text
branch id + commit timestamp + commit version -> commit version
branch id + commit version                    -> commit timestamp
```

Timestamp lookup returns the greatest retained commit version at or before the
requested timestamp. If multiple commits share a timestamp, the greatest commit
version is the deterministic tiebreaker.

The physical representation is a storage-owned system-row family under
`storage_space_id = 0x01`, defined in
`docs/architecture/storage/commit-timeline-substrate.md`. It is not a
separate L4 object service. L7 writes timeline rows in the same internal commit
unit as user rows; L8 recovery replays or validates those rows like any other
storage-owned durable row family.

## Recovery Interaction

L8 owns recovery orchestration. L7 owns commit replay rules.

During WAL replay:

1. L8 reads WAL records through L4.
2. L3 decodes commit payloads.
3. L8 submits recovered rows to L6 using the version and timestamp from the WAL.
4. L7's version clock catches up above the maximum recovered commit version.
5. L7 restores visible-version facts only after recovery has installed durable
   rows into L6.

V1 storage does not keep durable storage transaction IDs. If a future
private optimization reintroduces them, it must also add allocator catch-up
rules and tests.

Recovery replay should bypass normal conflict validation. The WAL record already
represents a committed durability fact.

Replay must be idempotent. Replaying the same durable commit after a crash must
not duplicate visible rows or corrupt row history.

## Commit Observers And Side Effects

Engine-owned post-commit side effects must stay above L7.

Examples:

- search index refresh
- graph audit hooks
- vector sidecar updates
- embedding queues
- inference-backed generation
- user-facing metrics or events

L7 may return `CommitOutcome` facts that engine observers consume. Observer
failure after durable commit must not turn the storage commit into a failure.

If a side effect must be part of storage atomicity, it is not a post-commit
observer; it must be represented as storage rows inside the same `CommitBatch`.

## Failure Model

L7 failures should be storage-local and phase-specific.

Important failures:

- invalid commit batch
- branch not writable
- branch deleting
- branch generation changed
- commit conflict
- commit timed out or exceeded configured limits
- version counter overflow
- WAL writer halted
- WAL append/sync failed
- commit durable but not visible
- L6 apply failed before visibility
- visibility publish failed
- commit quiesce unavailable or caller-level maintenance deadline
- unsupported durability capability for backend

Failure phases:

### Rejected Before Version Allocation

The commit is neither durable nor visible. Caller may retry after fixing the
input or conflict.

Examples:

- malformed batch
- branch deleting
- validation conflict
- write buffer limit exceeded

### Failed After Version Allocation But Before WAL Durability

The commit is not durable and not visible. A version gap may remain.

Version gaps are acceptable if the version model documents that versions are
monotonic, not dense.

### Failed After WAL Durability But Before Visibility

The commit is durable but not visible in the current process.

This must surface distinctly. L8 recovery must replay the WAL record on restart,
or an in-process repair path must install the durable commit before normal
writes resume.

### Failed After Visibility

The commit is visible. Later side-effect failures or observer failures should
not roll it back. Any required repair belongs to engine or L8 depending on the
side effect.

## Backend Matrix

| Backend mode | WAL required | Durable claim | L7 behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browser/cache | No | No crash durability | validate, version, apply to L6, publish visible |
| Local filesystem standard | Yes | WAL-backed crash recovery with bounded sync window | validate, version, L4 WAL append, L6 apply, publish visible, background/periodic sync |
| Local filesystem always | Yes | WAL-backed crash recovery with per-commit durability barrier | validate, version, L4 WAL append + force durability, L6 apply, publish visible |
| Future OpenDAL/object | Only if backend declares equivalent capability | Not V1 by default | fail fast unless L4 can provide a commit durability primitive |

L7 must not pretend an object backend is durable just because it can write
objects. It needs a durable commit primitive from L4.

## Testing Requirements

L7 needs direct tests that do not require engine primitives.

Unit tests:

1. Empty/read-only batch does not allocate a new commit version.
2. Mutating batch allocates exactly one commit version.
3. All rows in a batch share the same version and timestamp.
4. Puts and deletes in one batch become visible atomically.
5. Version gaps do not break latest, `getv`, or history reads.
6. Read-set conflicts are detected when validation facts are supplied.
7. CAS conflicts are detected.
8. Blind writes do not conflict if the retained model allows them.
9. Branch-deleting marker rejects commits before version allocation.
10. Branch generation mismatch rejects commits before visibility.
11. Counter overflow returns a typed error.

Concurrency tests:

1. Per-branch commit ordering is deterministic.
2. Commits on different branches do not corrupt global visible-version facts.
3. Commit quiesce drains in-flight commits and blocks new mutating commits.
4. Lock-order tests prove no path acquires locks out of order.
5. Long-running read snapshots do not let retention reclaim visible versions.

Durability tests:

1. WAL append failure leaves no visible rows.
2. Crash after WAL append and before visibility replays the commit.
3. L6 apply failure after WAL append returns durable-but-not-visible.
4. Recovery catches up the commit-version allocator.
5. WAL timestamps are preserved through recovery.
6. WAL-free cache mode does not claim crash durability.

Property/fuzz tests:

1. Random commit batches preserve atomic visibility.
2. Random interleavings of commits and quiesce never expose partial batches.
3. Random version gaps preserve ordered history.
4. Random conflict facts either commit with unchanged facts or reject cleanly.
5. Crash-point fuzzing across every commit phase preserves WAL-before-visible.

Guard tests:

1. Public storage API does not expose begin/commit/rollback transaction
   sessions.
2. Engine-next does not import WAL record structs or transaction internals.
3. L7 tests use storage-shaped rows, not engine primitive DTOs.

## V1 Minimum

The first storage L7 implementation needs:

1. Internal `CommitBatch`.
2. Single-branch mutating commit path.
3. Storage-owned monotonic commit-version allocator.
4. One commit timestamp per commit.
5. Optional read-set/CAS validation facts, preserving current conflict behavior.
6. Per-branch commit guard.
7. Commit quiesce guard.
8. Branch-deleting rejection.
9. WAL-before-visible through L4 for durable local `standard` and `always`
   modes.
10. WAL-free path for browser/cache mode with no crash durability claim.
11. Atomic L6 apply for puts and tombstones.
12. Visible-version publication after L6 apply.
13. Durable-but-not-visible error classification.
14. Recovery catch-up hooks for the commit-version allocator.
15. Direct L7 tests for conflict, ordering, WAL failure, version gaps, and
    crash-point behavior.

## Deferred Or Removed

Not required for V1:

1. Public transaction sessions.
2. User-facing ACID transaction commands.
3. Serializable isolation.
4. Distributed commits.
5. Multi-writer object-store durability.
6. Cross-branch atomic commit batches.
7. Savepoints.
8. Nested transactions.
9. Two-phase commit.
10. External transaction IDs as a public API.
11. Durable storage transaction IDs and transaction-ID allocator catch-up.

## Semantic Decisions

These decisions record intentional storage differences from old storage.
Differential tests should assert the replacement proof below instead of
weakening the oracle silently.

### Global Commit Admission

Decision: storage currently admits at most one mutating commit globally and
fails fast on contention.

Old behavior: old storage used per-branch commit locks. Same-branch contenders
blocked on the branch mutex, while unrelated branches could commit
concurrently. Pending-version tracking let visible-version advancement skip
over versions that were not yet applied.

Reason: the global unresolved-durable gate prevents later commits from
advancing visibility past a durable-not-applied or applied-not-visible commit.
This is more conservative than old storage and fixes an old failure window
where a WAL-durable commit whose L6 apply failed could be removed from pending,
allowing visible version to advance before recovery installed the durable rows.

Caller-visible contract: concurrent mutating commit attempts may receive a
typed admission/contention failure and must retry through L8/L9 policy. L7 does
not sleep, queue, or run retry loops.

Replacement proof:

1. a durable-not-applied commit blocks later mutating admission until recovery
   or reconciliation;
2. an applied-not-visible commit blocks unsafe cross-branch advancement;
3. same-branch and cross-branch contention return the documented typed facts;
4. any future per-branch admission design includes an equivalent
   pending-version or visible-advancement model before relaxing the global gate.

### Version Gaps And Visible Tracking

Decision: storage allows commit-version gaps after failures that occur
after version allocation but before branch apply and visible publication.

Old behavior: old storage used pending-version tracking to advance visibility
around unresolved versions. Some failure paths could remove a WAL-durable but
not-yet-applied version from pending before recovery installed the rows.

Reason: commit versions are ordering facts, not proof that user rows were made
visible. Storage-next keeps the visible-version tracker monotonic and flat, and
uses explicit unresolved-durable facts to prevent unsafe advancement when a
durable or applied row exists above visible. Allocation-only gaps are harmless:
they do not create user rows or commit timeline rows.

Replacement proof:

1. latest reads skip allocation-only gaps and return the newest visible row;
2. version-bounded reads at a gap return the newest visible row at or before
   the bound;
3. history contains only applied rows and remains sorted across gaps;
4. commit timeline lookup has no timestamp entry for allocation-only gaps.

### Explicit Missing Observed Version

Decision: storage represents missing validation facts explicitly instead
of using commit version zero as a sentinel.

Old behavior: old read-set validation used version zero to represent a missing
row.

Reason: explicit `Missing` avoids conflating absent rows with a synthetic
version value. `Present(0)` is invalid.

Replacement proof:

1. read-set and CAS validation tests cover missing, present, and deleted rows;
2. malformed `Present(0)` facts reject before visibility;
3. L9 exposes storage-shaped read facts without requiring callers to know
   internal sentinel values.

### Cache Applied-Not-Visible Semantics

Decision: if cache-mode apply succeeds but visible publication fails, the
applied row remains in branch state while the unresolved gate blocks unsafe
later advancement.

Old behavior: old cache-mode pending-version behavior did not expose the same
explicit applied-not-visible classification.

Reason: preserving the applied row gives same-branch read-your-writes behavior
for the failed commit path, while the unresolved gate prevents unrelated
branches from advancing global visibility past it by side effect.

Replacement proof:

1. same-branch latest reads can see the applied row after the classified
   failure;
2. cross-branch commits are blocked until the unresolved state is resolved;
3. the outcome/error classification is distinct from durable-not-applied.

### Commit Batch Limits

Decision: storage enforces explicit per-batch limits for mutations,
validation facts, and total commit rows.

Old behavior: old storage did not have the same storage V1 limits.

Reason: bounded commit batches keep validation, timeline-row creation, WAL
payload construction, and branch apply memory predictable.

Replacement proof:

1. limits are tested through L7 validation;
2. L9 documents the default limits and maps limit failures to typed storage
   errors;
3. benchmarks and supported callers stay within the configured defaults or
   raise them explicitly.

### Runtime Default Durability Mapping

Decision: public runtime-default commit durability is resolved by L9 from the
opened storage runtime, while L7 durable executors require explicit durable
commit modes.

Old behavior: old storage commit paths could be reached through multiple cache
and durable entry points, and internal defaulting could make it unclear whether
an omitted durability request meant cache mode or the opened durable policy.

Reason: storage keeps caller defaults at the API boundary and keeps lower
commit execution explicit. Cache runtimes map runtime-default and not-durable
requests to cache commits. Durable-local standard runtimes map runtime-default
to standard WAL commits. Durable-local always runtimes map runtime-default to
always-durable WAL commits. Durable executors reject cache-only commit batches
instead of silently weakening durability.

Replacement proof:

1. API tests prove runtime-default commits return standard or always summaries
   according to the opened durable runtime;
2. cache-runtime tests reject standard and always durability requests before
   mutation;
3. durable-runtime tests reject cache-only commit batches before allocation or
   WAL append;
4. source guards prove durable production paths do not construct commits with
   cache-default options accidentally.

### Admission Pressure Facts

Decision: L7 emits commit-local admission pressure facts, but does not enforce
write stalls, sleeps, retries, flushes, compactions, or scheduler work.

Old behavior: old storage had commit-time pressure and backpressure hooks that
could slow or stall writers and could wake maintenance work.

Reason: L7 is the commit primitive. It can describe the commit-local facts L8
needs, such as accepted-under-pressure, branch-guard rejection, unresolved
durable blocking, approximate bytes, mutation counts, and would-require-
maintenance hints. Enforcement needs source-shape, scheduler, and retry policy
owned by L8/L9.

Replacement proof:

1. perf-trace tests prove pressure facts are emitted for successful commits and
   retryable admission failures;
2. under-pressure commits that fail before allocation are not counted as
   accepted under pressure;
3. source guards prove commit code does not call flush, compaction,
   materialization, maintenance scheduling, or rate-limit loops;
4. L8 plans consume the facts for automatic maintenance and write-admission
   policy.

### Public Read-Set Facts

Decision: L7 preserves internal read-set and CAS validation, but storage
does not expose public begin/commit/rollback transaction sessions as the V1
product surface.

Old behavior: old storage had transaction-context APIs that could capture
read-set and CAS facts.

Reason: storage keeps the conflict model as a storage-shaped internal
commit capability. Product transaction sessions, if any, belong above L9.
The current L9-facing API exposes explicit per-key `CommitCondition` values as
CAS facts. It does not automatically capture point reads, scans, or history
queries into a hidden read set, and it does not reject write skew or unrelated
key changes unless the caller supplies storage facts for those keys.

L9 handoff:

1. `CommitCondition::expected_absent` maps to
   `CommitObservedVersion::Missing`.
2. `CommitCondition::expected_present(version)` maps to
   `CommitObservedVersion::Present(version)`, with version zero rejected before
   L7 admission.
3. A future M4P-L9B read-set surface may add explicit storage-shaped read facts
   over physical storage keys and observed versions, but it must map directly to
   `CommitReadFact` without introducing product transaction sessions.
4. Product DTOs, engine-specific invariants, and operation-level conflict policy
   remain above L9.

Replacement proof:

1. L7 tests directly prove read-set and CAS semantics;
2. L9 can expose storage-shaped read facts for engine without exposing
   transaction internals;
3. API tests prove public conditions are explicit CAS checks and do not capture
   unrelated reads;
4. public transaction sessions remain absent unless a separate product decision
   adds them.

### Read-Only Diagnostics Configuration

Decision: read-only diagnostics are an explicit L7 diagnostic capability and may
be disabled by `CommitRuntimeConfig`.

Old behavior: old storage did not expose the same storage read-only commit
diagnostic shape.

Reason: diagnostics are useful for L7/L8/L9 tests and operators, but they must
not become an implicit write path or an always-enabled product contract.

L9 handoff: when disabled, L7 returns the typed disabled-diagnostics commit
error before allocating a commit version or touching branch state. L9 maps that
to the stable unsupported-capability storage API category without exposing
`CommitRuntimeError` or other internal commit runtime types.

Replacement proof:

1. direct L7 tests prove enabled diagnostics return a snapshot without commit
   allocation;
2. disabled diagnostics return the documented typed error and leave visible
   version unchanged;
3. API/L9 mapping tests must keep the error storage-shaped and hide L7 internals.

## Measured Optimization Gates

These gates are intentionally measure-first. The baseline measurement on
2026-06-11 used `benchmarks/src/bin/storage_next_l9_scale.rs` against
storage commit `306b9184`:

```text
cargo run --release --manifest-path benchmarks/Cargo.toml \
  --bin storage-l9-scale -- \
  --scales 100k --engines standard --workloads load-seq \
  --batch-size 1000 --value-bytes 64 \
  --root /tmp/strata-l7-gates \
  --results-dir /tmp/strata-l7-gates-results
```

The run loaded 100,000 rows through 100 durable commits at 644,777 rows/s.
It also ran targeted `perf-trace` L7 tests for replay classification,
branch-registry scaling, global durable-admission contention, and same-branch
guard contention.

| Gate | Current status | Measurement result | Re-evaluate when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Replay bulk classification | Deferred | The L9 load workload has no recovery, so `replay_classification_calls=0`, `replay_rows_classified=0`, `replay_history_calls=0`, and `replay_source_probes=0`. Targeted replay tests confirm one history call per row in the current classifier, but only a single-source fixture was exercised. | Recovery telemetry shows `commit_replay_history_calls > 10000` in one replay pass and `commit_replay_source_probes / commit_replay_rows_classified > 1`. |
| Indexed branch registry lookup | Deferred | Single-branch L9 load is the best case: `commit_branch_registry_lookups=200` and `commit_branch_registry_descriptors_scanned=200`. The 1,024-branch scale test confirms the intentional linear shape with 2,048 descriptors scanned for two lookups. | A real workload registers more than 100 active branches and `commit_branch_registry_descriptors_scanned / commit_branch_registry_lookups > 10`, or branch admission latency becomes visible in a high-branch-count benchmark. |
| WAL encode buffer pooling | Closed | Durable L9 load stressed the relevant path: `commit_wal_encode_buffer_allocations=3`, `commit_wal_encode_buffer_reuses=397`, `commit_wal_records_built=100`, and `commit_wal_record_rows=100200`. Buffer reuse was 99.25 percent, so durable commit throughput is not allocating fresh WAL encode buffers per commit. | Re-open only if a future durable workload shows low reuse, for example `commit_wal_encode_buffer_reuses / (allocations + reuses) < 0.95`, together with WAL build time or allocator profiling as a throughput bottleneck. |
| Per-branch concurrent commit admission | Deferred | Sequential L9 load does not exercise contention: `commit_unresolved_gate_admission_attempts=100`, `commit_unresolved_gate_admission_acquired=100`, `commit_unresolved_gate_rejected_active=0`, and `commit_unresolved_gate_rejected_unresolved=0`. Targeted tests prove cross-branch contenders fail fast before WAL while the global admission token is held. | A concurrent multi-branch benchmark exists and `commit_unresolved_gate_rejected_active / commit_unresolved_gate_admission_attempts > 0.05`, or multi-tenant callers show global admission as the dominant commit bottleneck. |
| Same-branch blocking admission | Deferred | Sequential L9 load does not exercise branch-guard contention: `commit_branch_guard_attempts=100`, `commit_branch_guard_acquired=100`, and `commit_branch_guard_rejected=0`. Targeted tests prove `BranchGuardUnavailable` fails before conflict validation, allocation, WAL append, and visible publication. | L8 or L9 grows retry loops around `BranchGuardUnavailable`, or a same-branch concurrent writer benchmark shows guard rejection as a sustained caller-visible retry cost. |

Deferral means the triggering workload was not exercised by the L9 load
measurement. It is not proof that the optimization will never matter. The WAL
buffer-pooling gate is the exception: the measured workload exercised the
durable WAL encode path directly and showed high reuse.

## Open Questions

1. What exact storage-shaped read facts should M4P-L9B expose for future
   engine callers, and which engine adapter emits them?
2. Should commit versions remain global, or should storage introduce per-branch
   visible versions while preserving global ordering for history and recovery?
3. What exact row value representation should `CommitRow` carry: storage
   `Value`, opaque bytes, or an L3-encoded row payload?
4. Should branch generation guards stay in engine branch-control logic, or move
   into storage branch metadata once storage owns branch lifecycle
   mechanics?
5. How much of the current transaction pool optimization is worth preserving
   once public transaction sessions are removed?
6. What metrics are stable L7 facts versus L8 health aggregation?

Question 4 is also an engine architecture input. Engine-next must decide
which product branch-generation guarantees it expects storage to enforce
mechanically before the L7 implementation plan freezes.

## Next Step

The next storage document should define L8 Lifecycle / Recovery /
Maintenance. It should explain storage open sequencing, recovery replay,
checkpoint orchestration, compaction scheduling, retention scheduling,
quarantine/repair, shutdown, and how L8 consumes L4-L7 without taking ownership
of backend IO, table mechanics, branch semantics, or commit ordering.
