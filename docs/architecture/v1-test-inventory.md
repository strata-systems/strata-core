# V1 Test Inventory

Status: M0TE populated inventory

## Purpose

This file is the canonical M0TE inventory of existing test files and their V1
disposition.

Existing tests are evidence, not authority. A file marked `Keep` or `Rewrite`
still has to satisfy the V1 engineering standards when it is ported. A file
marked `Archive` or `Delete` must not constrain V1 behavior.

## Scope

This inventory covers 212 files:

1. root test files and test support under `tests/`;
2. crate integration tests under `crates/*/tests/`;
3. explicit source test modules under `crates/*/src/**/tests/`;
4. benchmark source, baseline, history, and result files under `benchmarks/`,
   excluding generated build output under `benchmarks/target/`;
5. current benchmark files under `crates/*/benches/`;
6. fixture and proptest-regression files consumed by those tests.

Inline unit tests embedded inside ordinary production source files are not
listed one-by-one here. They move with their owning module during M1-M10 and
must follow the same action as that module's V1 owner.

## Classification Legend

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `v1_decision` | Required, Optional, Redesign, Remove, Evidence-only |
| `action` | Keep, Rewrite, Archive, Delete |
| `target_track` | `M1T` through `M10T`, or `none` for archive/delete/support-only rows |
| `target_epic` | Planned test epic when known, otherwise `none` |

## Summary

| Area | Default disposition |
|---|---|
| Core identifier and public-surface guards | Rewrite into M1/M5/M9 guard tests. |
| Storage durability, recovery, branch visibility, and segmented-store tests | Rewrite into M3/M4 storage conformance, property, and fault tests. |
| Engine primitive, branch, relationship, versioning, and retrieval tests | Rewrite into M5/M6 engine conformance and product-path tests. |
| Intelligence search and model-orchestration tests | Rewrite into M8 intelligence-next tests. |
| Executor, CLI, IPC, and command tests | Rewrite into M9 cutover tests, except removed commands. |
| Follower mode, branch tags/notes, public transaction sessions, branch bundles, and normal-user maintenance workflows | Delete or archive; V1 guard tests must prove absence. |
| Stress, adversarial, and benchmark files | Rewrite into M10 readiness/performance gates. |

## M0TE Closure

M0TE is closed when:

1. every file in the inventory scope has a row above;
2. every row has a V1 decision and action;
3. every executable or fixture `Keep` or `Rewrite` row has a target track;
4. every `Delete` or `Archive` row explains the removed or historical behavior;
5. later milestones can filter this document by `target_track` before porting
   tests.
